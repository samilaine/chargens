# Various RFC864 Implementations

Several TCP implementations of RFC864-compliant character generator services.

The filenames should be obvious, but just in case they're not: Anything
with "good" in it will implement a character generator exactly as RFC864
recommends, and the rest, well, they'll be RFC864-compliant, but don't
implement a character generator exactly as RFC864 recommends.

Nothing besides a vanilla Python 3.x interpreter is required.

Run with `python goodchargen.py` (for example).
